/* Differences Between Transformers and Interceptors

An interceptor can be used to intercept the request/response at various points,
as discussed above. But transformers can be applied just before sending a request
or after receiving a response. Another important consideration is that, using
transformers, you just get access to data and headers of request/response while
interceptors have access to the config object.
